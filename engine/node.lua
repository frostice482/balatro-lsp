--- Node represents any game object that needs to have some transform available in the game itself. \
--- Everything that you see in the game is a Node, and some invisible things like the G.ROOM are also represented here.
--- @class balatro.Node: balatro.Object
---
--- Store all argument and return tables here for reuse, because Lua likes to generate garbage
--- @field ARGS any
--- @field RETS any
--- Config table used for any metadata about this node
--- @field config balatro.Node.Config | table
--- For transform init, accept params in the form x|1, y|2, w|3, h|4, r|5
--- @field T balatro.Node.TransformUnit
--- Transform to use for collision detection
--- @field CT balatro.Node.TransformUnit
--- used to determine things like drag offset and 3d shader effectsformUnit
--- @field click_offset Position
--- used to determine things like drag offset and 3d shader effects
--- @field hover_offset Position
--- To keep track of all nodes created on pause. If true, this node moves normally even when the G.TIMERS.TOTAL doesn't increment
--- @field created_on_pause boolean
--- ID tracker, every Node has a unique IDn_pause boolean
--- @field ID number
--- Frame tracker to aid in not doing too many extra calculations
--- @field FRAME balatro.Node.Frame
--- The states for this Node and all derived nodes.
--- This is how we control the visibility and interactibility of any object.
--- All nodes do not collide by default.
--- This reduces the size of n for the O(n^2) collision detection
--- @field states balatro.Node.State
--- If we provide a container, all nodes within that container are translated with that container as the reference frame.\
--- For example, if G.ROOM is set at x = 5 and y = 5, and we create a new game object at 0, 0, it will actually be drawn at 5, 5.\
--- This allows us to control things like screen shake, room positioning, rotation, padding, etc. without needing to modify\
--- every game object that we need to draw
--- @field container balatro.Node
--- The list of children give Node a treelike structure.
--- This can be used for things like drawing, deterministice movement and parallax calculations
--- when child nodes rely on updated information from parents,
--- and inherited attributes like button click functions.
--- @field children table<string, balatro.Node>
---
--- Set by `Moveable`. For `Node`, this is used for debugging.
--- @field CALCING? boolean
---
--- Text value to show when G.DEBUG is true. Used for debugging.
--- @field DEBUG_VALUE? string

--- @field REMOVED? boolean

--- Determines if this node collides with some point. Applies any container translations and rotations, then applies translations and rotations specific to this node. \
--- This means the collision detection effectively determines if some point intersects this node regargless of rotation.

--- Translation function used before any draw calls,
--- translates this node according to the transform of the container node
function INode:translate_container() end

--- When this Node needs to be deleted, removes self from any tables it may have been added to destroy any weak references.
--- Also calls the remove method of all children to have them do the same
